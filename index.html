                <h3>The Legacy of the Magi</h3>
                <p>Most people have heard of the story of how the Star of Bethlehem led the Magi to the infant Jesus. There have been many theories about what appeared in the sky that caused the Magi to embark on their journey to find the new King of the Jews. As an astronomer, I too have wondered what the Magi saw, but never thought that I could find it until I stumbled upon an important clue.</p>

                <p>My investigations show that there indeed was a Star of Bethlehem exactly as reported in the Bible. My book describes the evidence I gleaned from ancient coins and astrological records - important information that was unnoticed by earlier investigators. Here are some of the important findings in my book:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="findings-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>A serendipitous discovery, originating from Roman coins of Antioch, revealed that Aries the Ram was the sign of the Jews and that the Magi's star appeared in that sign of the zodiac. (pp. 3-4)</li>
                    <li>The Magi were highly respected "wise men" who practiced Greek astrology, the precursor of modern astrology. (p. 42)</li>
                    <li>Ancient stargazers described in detail the celestial conditions for the births of kings and emperors. Their writings describe the Magi's star. (p. 64)</li>
                    <li>The star was not a comet, nor was it a supernova. (pp. 17-25)</li>
                    <li>The people of Jerusalem did not see the star because they did not understand Greek astrology - but Herod did and took action. (p. 11)</li>
                    <li>As stated in the Bible, the Magi's star did indeed appear "in the east" in Aries. The book describes the unusual celestial conditions of that day, which signified the birth of the Messiah. (p. 89)</li>
                    <li>The Magi rejoiced that the star later "went before and stood over" - a secondary sign confirming the birth of the King of the Jews. (pp. 87-96)</li>
                    <li>December 25th was not the birth day of Jesus, nor does the Christian Era (A.D. 1) determine the year Jesus was born. (pp. 55-57)</li>
                    <li>A Christian Roman astrologer wrote that the celestial conditions I describe marked the birth of a "divine and immortal" person - a likely reference to the birth of Jesus. (pp. 104-108)</li>
                    <li>The ancient documents show that the horoscope for this day was more significant than the important horoscopes of the Emperors Augustus Caesar and Hadrian. (pp. 98-102)</li>
                    <li>The Magi's star appeared two years before the death of Herod, which explains why two year old children were condemned as threats to his throne. (pp. 117-118)</li>
                    <li>The account of Luke refers to the "census" of Quirinius under Augustus Caesar - a connection to the Roman coins of Antioch. (pp. 121-123)</li>
                    <li>Emperor Nero was marked as the biblical Antichrist - a prophecy related to the presence of Aries the Ram in his horoscope. (pp. 109-116)</li>
                </ul>
