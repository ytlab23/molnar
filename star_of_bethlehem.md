## The Legacy of the Magi

Most people have heard of the story of how the Star of Bethlehem led the
Magi to the infant Jesus. There have been many theories about what
appeared in the sky that caused the Magi to embark on their journey to
find the new King of the Jews. As an astronomer, I too have wondered
what the Magi saw, but never thought that I could find it until I
stumbled upon an important clue.

My investigations show that there indeed was a Star of Bethlehem exactly
as reported in the Bible. My book describes the evidence I gleaned from
ancient coins and astrological records - important information that was
unnoticed by earlier investigators. Here are some of the important
findings in my book:

-   A serendipitous discovery, originating from Roman coins of Antioch,
    revealed that Aries the Ram was the sign of the Jews and that the
    Magi's star appeared in that sign of the zodiac. (pp. 3-4)
-   The Magi were highly respected "wise men" who practiced Greek
    astrology, the precursor of modern astrology. (p. 42)
-   Ancient stargazers described in detail the celestial conditions for
    the births of kings and emperors. Their writings describe the Magi's
    star. (p. 64)
-   The star was not a comet, nor was it a supernova. (pp. 17-25)
-   The people of Jerusalem did not see the star because they did not
    understand Greek astrology - but Herod did and took action. (p. 11)
-   As stated in the Bible, the Magi's star did indeed appear "in the
    east" in Aries. The book describes the unusual celestial conditions
    of that day, which signified the birth of the Messiah. (p. 89)
-   The Magi rejoiced that the star later "went before and stood over" -
    a secondary sign confirming the birth of the King of the Jews.
    (pp. 87-96)
-   December 25th was not the birth day of Jesus, nor does the Christian
    Era (A.D. 1) determine the year Jesus was born. (pp. 55-57)
-   A Christian Roman astrologer wrote that the celestial conditions I
    describe marked the birth of a "divine and immortal" person - a
    likely reference to the birth of Jesus. (pp. 104-108)
-   The ancient documents show that the horoscope for this day was more
    significant than the important horoscopes of the Emperors Augustus
    Caesar and Hadrian. (pp. 98-102)
-   The Magi's star appeared two years before the death of Herod, which
    explains why two year old children were condemned as threats to his
    throne. (pp. 117-118)
-   The account of Luke refers to the "census" of Quirinius under
    Augustus Caesar - a connection to the Roman coins of Antioch.
    (pp. 121-123)
-   Emperor Nero was marked as the biblical Antichrist - a prophecy
    related to the presence of Aries the Ram in his horoscope.
    (pp. 109-116)

I hope that you will find this new information as fascinating as I did.
